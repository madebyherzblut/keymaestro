# Keymaestro

Keymaestro is a simple micro-library for defining and dispatching keyboard shortcuts in web applications. It has no dependencies and is based on the battle-tested [keymaster.js](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) by Thomas Fuchs.

## Differences to keymaster.js

* [x] Actively maintained
* [ ] Modern code with no exported global
* [ ] Cross browser test suite

More to come in the future.
